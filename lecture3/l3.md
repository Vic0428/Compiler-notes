## Add `ELet`

Example of one valid program: `(Let (x 5) (Inc x))` 

We need to store variables on stack (memory location) and our compiler has a mapping between variable and address
```ocaml
type tenv = (string * int) list

(*
    env is mapping 
        1. names to values (runtime)
        2. names to locations / addrs (compile time)
    
    The first approach is better for interepter and may be useful in compiler optimization part 
*)

(Let (x (read_int)) (Inc x))
```
