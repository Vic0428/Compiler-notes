## Add `ELet`

Example of one valid program: `(Let (x 5) (Inc x))` 

We need to store variables on stack (memory location) and our compiler has a mapping between variable and address
```ocaml
type tenv = (string * int) list

(*
    env is mapping 
        1. names to values (runtime)
        2. names to locations / addrs (compile time)
    
    The first approach is better for interepter and may be useful in compiler optimization part 
*)

(Let (x (read_int)) (Inc x))
```

## Add binary operation

Let's add the `+` operator and the following example is valid

`(+ 6 (+ 3 1))`

```ocaml
type expr = 
  | ENum of int
  | EOp of op * expr
  | ELet of string * expr * expr
  | EId of string
  | EPlus of expr * expr

```

The order of evaluate binary operaiton is important. Because sometimes the lefthand side and righthand side expression has side effects (altering global states / print to io). 

**Very important in optimization to consider the side effects**

```ocaml
(+ 5 (- 7 3))
---------------------
mov rax, 5
mov [rsp - 8], rax
 mov rax, 7
  mov [rsp - 16], rax
   mov rax, 3
  mov [rsp - 24], rax
  mov rax, [rsp - 16]
  sub rax, [rsp - 24]
mov [rsp - 16], rax
mov rax, [rsp - 8]
add rax, [rsp - 16]
---------------------
```
