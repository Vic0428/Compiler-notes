# Lecture 4

## Add booleans, comparisons, and if to this language 

The idea: false = 0, true = 1 and nonzero takes then branch
```ocaml
expr := <number> | true | false
     | if <expr> <expr> <expr>
     | ...........
```

Is the following a good idea? (let `true = 1` and `false = 0`)
```
(let (true 1) (let (false 0) (expr))) 
```
The downside of this approach is that in the inner expression `true` and `false` can be redefined.
