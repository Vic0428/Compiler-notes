# Lecture 4

## Add booleans, comparisons, and if to this language 

The idea: false = 0, true = 1 and nonzero takes then branch ( `c`-like design)
```ocaml
expr := <number> | true | false
     | if <expr> <expr> <expr>
     | ...........
```

Is the following a good idea? (let `true = 1` and `false = 0`)
```
(let (true 1) (let (false 0) (expr))) 
```
The downside of this approach is that in the inner expression `true` and `false` can be redefined. So we should make `true` and `false` as keywords



Next step, add some comparisons and logical expressions
```ocaml
op := (add <expr> <expr>)
    | (binop <expr> <expr>)

binop := > | < | =
```

Let's look at a small assembly example
```
if (0) answer = 5;
else answer = 2;

------------------

mov rax, 0
cmp rax, 0
je else_branch
mov rax, 5
jmp after_if
else_branch:
mov rax, 2
after_if:
```
