# Lecture 4

## Add booleans, comparisons, and if to this language 

The idea: false = 0, true = 1 and nonzero takes then branch ( `c`-like design)
```ocaml
expr := <number> | true | false
     | if <expr> <expr> <expr>
     | ...........
```

Is the following a good idea? (let `true = 1` and `false = 0`)
```
(let (true 1) (let (false 0) (expr))) 
```
The downside of this approach is that in the inner expression `true` and `false` can be redefined. So we should make `true` and `false` as keywords



Next step, add some comparisons and logical expressions
```ocaml
op := (add <expr> <expr>)
    | (binop <expr> <expr>)

binop := > | < | =
```

Let's look at a small assembly example
```
if (0) answer = 5;
else answer = 2;

------------------

mov rax, 0
cmp rax, 0
je else_branch
mov rax, 5
jmp after_if
else_branch:
mov rax, 2
after_if:
```

Next, we need to consider how to achieve `LT ` comparisons

First approach: branch and move value
```
EBinop(LT, e1, e2) -> 

     cmp e1, e2
     jl is_less_than
is_not_less_than:
     ....
     mov rax, 0
     jmp after_branch
is_less_than:
     ....
     mov rax, 1
after_branch:
     ....
```

Second approach: branchless to avoid labels for `LT` comparisons

We can subtract two numbers and the first bit of the result is 1 then negative. 

```
     sub rax, [rsp - ..]
     shr rax, 63
     jne is_less_than:
is_not_less_than:
     ....
     jmp after_branch
is_les_than:
     ....
after_branch:
     ....
```

Suppose that we want some type check `(+ 1 true) => ERROR`

A little bit chance to the return type of `e_to_is` function
```ocaml
let rec e_to_is (e : expr) (si : int) (env : tenv) = 
(* Return type: (type * string list) *)
```
1. Calculate types of exprs
2. Env that tracks types
