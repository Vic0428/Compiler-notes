# Lecture 2

Check out `Rust` language

 Today most focusing on parsing 

- Compiler courses more than two weeks (when talk about parsing)
  (Very frontend of the compiler)
- But I don’t do that…
  (There are much resource about parsers)

131 like a backend compiler courses

Our goal is: solving precedence is not interesting

Make parsing that very easy -> idea called `s-expression` 
(Every expression will have `()`) 

Ever seen the syntax before?

- The lisp
- Racket
- Scheme

No question and very regular => easy to parse

Data formats in a programming course

- Json: lots of curly braces (every common)
  - Being used as configuration files
- Xml: have really many attributes (looks like `html`)
  - Serialize data format
- The source code of programming language
  - Another serialize data format

Not universally, there are programming languages that takes source language (web assembly) into `s-expression`. 

High-level intuition 

- The first step
  - From string to list of strings: based on how we define token
  - Reduce spacing..
  - Tokens (number tokens, operators, `()`) 
  - Token -> regular expression (map operators, digits, `()`) 

- The second step: parse (take string list into some kind of trees)
  - No `()` in my trees (the tree is useful)
  - All `()` is captured in the tree structure
  - Figure out what need to be a subtree?
  - Insight: into flat list into trees -> write recursive function

There is a library for `s-expressions` since they are very common. 

You may never need to implement your self. 

In `ocaml`, there is a library called `sexplib`
